Daemon for managing mappings between FQDN domain names and IP's.

Daemon listen on unix socket and accept simple string (simple nc) like
update <list of fqdn names splitted by \n> or drop <list of fqdn names>

If update command emitted, then alluvium do dns lookups and resolve fqdn 
into all assigned ip's, and then put them into ipset. And then, each
dns zone ttl expire do refresh for fqdn <-> ip resolution.

If drop command emitted, then simply remove ip's from ipset and stop
dns zone watching.
